## Description
Pine is a web app that takes your cravings and guides you where to get the dish which you crave, or, show you how to make what you're craving at home using our simple recipes. Pine utilizes googles geo location and places api to find 3 nearby restauants that have the dish that you are craving. If you're not for takeout, Pine will display the ingredients of the dish and the method for making it, step-by-step. By heading to a dish's ingredients page, you can add the ingredients you need to buy to your shopping list and check off the ones you have.
