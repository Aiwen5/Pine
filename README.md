## Description
Pine is a web app that takes your cravings and guides you where to get the dish which you crave, or, show you how to make what you're craving at home using simple recipes rated by other users. Pine will utilize a geo location api to find a nearby restauant that has the dish that you are craving. If you're not for takeout, Pine will display the ingrediants of the dish and the method for making it, step-by-step.
